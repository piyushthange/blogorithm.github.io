			<p style="color: red;"> *Note: Reading is the most "CRUCIAL" part of Kernel Development & I quote myself
				"With great Reading comes great Knowledge & desire to create something." You must have good knowledege
				of C, Git, handy Linux Command line & OS(Basic concepts) to get started with this development series.
			</p>

			<p>The first question you should ask yourself is "WHAT's the reason you landed here?" It could be anything
				like your boss told you to learn something about kernel/subsystem OR you just want to explore the kernel
				world for fun OR you want to get started with kernel development but don't know where and how to start
				i.e what's the 0<sup>th</sup> bit and how to turn it to 1 and so on...<br>
				For me it's simple I desire to be a <em>"Kernel developer"</em> it's funny but this name really
				fascinates me. So I hope you have got the answer and now we move on to our opening move.

			<h3>What is <em>KERNEL</em>?</h3>
			Have you ever wondered how and editor works or how the game starts and why does the game has a fancy
			<em>Loading...</em>
			bar at the beginning? Why you need a big chunkier graphics card to play games?
			The answer to this is the Operating System which is synonymously used for KERNEL. The main function of the
			kernel
			is to interact with the hardware(RAM, CPU, Storage Devices, Keyboard) and provides an execution
			platform to application programs so that the user can be at concinience and do his work effectively without
			worrying about the resources available. Now if you want to play a game and you click the icon of game so as
			to
			open it. To do this the game has to request the kernel to use hardware resources like monitor, keyborad,
			mouse, GPU
			& whatever applies to play. Then the kernel evaluates the request and check wheather the permissions game is
			asking
			are fine or is there an illegal access of memory or if the hardware isn't available. If anything related to
			it is improper it'll send some signal to the monitor that there's an issue with hardware or memory access or
			so on
			and stop it right there. Hence in modern OS's the user programs cannot play with the low-level hardware of
			the
			computer system so as to prevent a crash of working system and never retrieving it back. Ok now we have know
			what
			kernel is now let's look what's the history of kernel & where it has evolved from.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h3> Behind The Scenes of Linux Kernel</h3>
			We'll just look at the history of Linux in just a snap.
			Linux is based on Unix but it's not Unix. Unix was only used in the universities & was created at
			AT&T Bell labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and other team members.
			Linux was started by <b>Linus Torvalds</b> as a hobby project & launched a simple email
			(see it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux#The_creation_of_Linux" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"> here</a>)on the internet which lead to one of the biggest open project on
			internet. People got onboard for providing their contributions to linux where Linus Torvalds became a
			benevolent dictator & still continues to be one. The Linux Kernel is being developed by <em>Hobbyists</em>,
			company heired employees to contribute to specific subsystems, engineers and many more around the globe over
			the internet using <em>mails</em> (sending, acknowledging, reviewing, agreeing & disagreeing).<br>
			Now that the kernel is defined the thing to note in here is that the Linux kernel is open sourced licensed
			under GPL v2.0 i.e anyone personally can change it, use it and dustribute it for free. If the changes are
			good then it should be sent to upstream and get the changes accepted by the maintainer of particular
			subsystem and then the maintainers forward these changes to Linus so as the changes get merged in kernel.
			There are three levels of people in development
			<ol>
				<li> Linus Torvalds - Creator & Maintainer of Linux Kernel. Accept patches from Subsystem Maintainers
				</li>
				<li> Subsytem Maintainers - Subsystem(wifi, usb, ipc, mm) can have one or more maintainers.</li>
				<li> Contributors/Developers - Send fixes in the kernel after testing to a particular assigned
					maintainer or developer.</li>
			</ol>
			Linux is open sourced i.e the source code of linux is free. Anyone can edit, use & redistribute the code.
			Linux Kernel is Licensed under GPL-2.0(General Public License V-2.0). There could be multiple Licenses as
			per a particular source file. These are available in COPYING File(Described further). Read the
			<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> GPL-2.0</a><br>
			Subsystem... What's that? It'll get clearer as time grows and as you keep reading. Ok that's a bit of
			mouthful and we'll stop here and meet in the next blog so just stay tuned and keep learning. Enjoy...!<br>
