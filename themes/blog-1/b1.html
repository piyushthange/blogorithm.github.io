  <p style="color: red;"> *Note: Reading is the most "CURCIAL" part of Kernel Development & 
	I quote myself "With great Reading comes great Knowledge & desire to acquire something."
	You must have good knowledege of C, Git, handy Linux Command line & OS(Basic concepts)
	to get started with this development series.
  </p>

  <p>The first question you should ask yourself is "WHAT's the reason you landed here?" It could be anything like
	Your boss told you to learn something about kernel/subsystem OR you just want to explore the kernel world for fun OR
	you want to get started with kernel development but don't know where and how to start i.e what's the 
	0<sup>th</sup> bit and how to turn it to 1 and so on...<br>
	For me it's simple I desire to be a <em>"Kernel developer"</em> it's funny but this name really fascinates me.
	So I hope you have got the answer and now we move on to our opening move.	
  </p>

	<h3>What is <em>KERNEL</em>?</h3>
	Have you ever wondered how and editor works or how the game starts and why does the game has a fancy <em>Loading...</em>
	bar at the beginning? Why you need a big chunkier graphics card to play games?
	The answer to this is the Operating System which is synonymously used for KERNEL. The main function of the kernel
	is to interact with the hardware(RAM, CPU, Storage Devices, Keyboard) and provides an execution
	platform to application programs so that the user can be at concinience and do his work effectively without
	worrying about the resources available. Now if you want to play a game and you clik the icon of game so as to
	open it. To do this the game has to request the kernel to use hardware resources like monitor, keyborad, mouse, GPU
	& whatever applies to play. Then the kernel evaluates the request and check wheather the permissions game is asking
	are fine or is there an illegal access of memory or if the hardware isn't available. If anything related to 
	it is improper it'll send some signal to the monitor that there's an issue with hardware or memory access or so on
 	and stop it then there. Hence in modern OS's the user programs cannot play with the low-level hardware of the
	computer system so as to prevent a crash of working and system and never retrieving it back.

	<h3>Who are involved in the development of the Linux Kernel?</h3>
	We'll just look at the history of Linux in just a snap. 
	This project was started by <b>Linus Torvalds</b> projecting a simple email
	(see it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux#The_creation_of_Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
	here</a>)
	on the internet and getting people onboard for contribution and he a benevolent dictator till date.	
	The Linux Kernel is being developed by <em>Hobbyists</em> around the globe over the internet 
	using mails(sending, replying, reviewing, agreeing & disagreeing).<br>
	Now that the kernel is defined the thing to
	note in here is that the Linux kernel is open sourced licensed under GPL v2.0 i.e anyone personally can change it,
	use it and dustribute it for free. If the changes are good then it should be sent to upstream and 
	get the changes accepted by the maintainer of particular subsystem and then the maintainers forward
	changes to Linus so as the changes get merged in kernel.
		In my sense there are three levels of people in development
	<ol>
		<li> Linus Torvalds - Maintainer of Linux Kernel</li>
		<li> Subsytem Maintainers - Subsystem can have one or more maintainers.</li>
		<li> Contributors/Developers - Send fixes in the kernel and be the part of development.</li>
	</ol>
	Subsystem... What's that? It'll get clearer as time grows and you keep reading.

	Next we're stepping in a new
