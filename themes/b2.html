Let's get started with a new session with understanding some new term's like Mail client, Patch, Release Cycle, Cscope, ctags, git, ncurses, vim(Text editor), dwarves,etc. 
The kernel development takes place on mailing lists. Make changes in the kernel test them create a patch send them to respective maintainer & mailing list. Get the patch reviewed & accepted or rejected that's it.
A patch is a change made in the kernel source & this can be send through mail.
To create a patch git is the tool in hand for us.
we can use <code class="language-bash"> git format-patch -1 </code>
After formatting patches you can check who's exactly the mainter of that subsystem using <code class="language-bash">scripts/get_maintainer.pl name.patch</code>. Cscope is a finding tool

To check if the patch has coding style correct or not you can use <code class="language-bash">scripts/checkpatch.pl filename</code>

<h3>Mail clients & how to not let them suck your brain</h3>
There are multiple email clients such as mutt, claws, evolution, thunderbird,etc. Now as we are quite new to this environment I'll prefer to choose thunderbird as it's GUI based & I think it ships with major distributions in the market like ubuntu.
